- Mute button does not stay in "muted" sprite mode after death in muted mode.
- Sometimes, asteroids will hit the player during the fade transition between rooms
- Not exactly a bug, but the color of the cursor is too identical to some of the room backgrounds

I'm sure there's more, but I'm way too tired to look for them.
For whoever has this project, sorry that the code is as ugly as it is. I was aiming for speed, not elegance.
I'll probably refactor it after the compo.
